v0.1.5
    - Added support for outputing A5 PDFs for A6 perfect binding.
v0.1.4
    - Added dynamic scaling of input PDFs. Now the input PDF can be any size;
      however, for best results it should be A6.
v0.1.3
    - Fixed a bug that caused the two lower A6 pages on each A4 page to be
      switched.
v0.1.2
    - Fixed an issue with the package structure. The script did not work once
      installed before this.
v0.1.1
    - Changed how the usage-message from the script is displayed.
v0.1.0
    - First release to pypi and GitHub
